ok. so doing this. What works and doesn't work?

reaper?
    i don't think wineasio is installed, no sound when i run
    i can't get wineasio to install, i get an error that wine/debug.h is missing

juce plugin host
    loading juce demo plugin crashes everything!

ardour
    don't know where to put the plugins
    is there sound? yes there is sound. so maybe ardour is the way to go about this?
