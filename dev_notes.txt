ok. so doing this. What works and doesn't work?

reaper?
    i don't think wineasio is installed, no sound when i run
    i can't get wineasio to install, i get an error that wine/debug.h is missing

juce plugin host
    loading juce demo plugin crashes everything!

ardour
    don't know where to put the plugins
    is there sound? yes there is sound. so maybe ardour is the way to go about this?
    reading ardour manual
        what i produce are vsts, with .so extension which is linux for dll
        only vst 2.4 is supported
            ok, so maybe that is why everything crashed when I used the juce demo stuff
           from manual: Linux VST (LXVST) plugins are distributed as shared library files. They are
           typically installed in /usr/lib/lxvst, /usr/local/lib/lxvst or a directory mentioned in
           your LXVST_PATH environment variable.

ok. so ardour is a pain. I got bitwig to work with jack audio device. start from there? Like try to
compile juce demo plugin to make it work in bitwig?
