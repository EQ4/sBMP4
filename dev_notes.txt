USING PLUGINS IN A DAW ON UBUNTU

reaper?
    i don't think wineasio is installed, no sound when i run
    i can't get wineasio to install, i get an error that wine/debug.h is missing

juce plugin host
    * apparently this now works! with pulse as audio interface. 
    * need to NOT have any inputs because it makes it glitchy af.
ardour
    don't know where to put the plugins
    is there sound? yes there is sound. so maybe ardour is the way to go about this?
    reading ardour manual
        what i produce are vsts, with .so extension which is linux for dll
        only vst 2.4 is supported
            ok, so maybe that is why everything crashed when I used the juce demo stuff
           from manual: Linux VST (LXVST) plugins are distributed as shared library files. They are
           typically installed in /usr/lib/lxvst, /usr/local/lib/lxvst or a directory mentioned in
           your LXVST_PATH environment variable.

    * audio works with jack audio device. 
    * plugins are indexed but i don't see them when adding plugins on a track.

TODO
    * LINUX	
        * actually, now juce plugin host is no longer working. crashes when opening sBMP4, which it does on startup
        * figure out how to use ctags
        * figure out how to run reaper
    * OTHER
        * use this library for filters: https://github.com/vinniefalco/DSPFilters
            * i got the RBJ filter working, but it causes some noise (see reaper project). Need to
            * perhaps use parameter smooting (this seems to not cause noise in the dsp filter juce
            * demo app)
