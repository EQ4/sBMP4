USING PLUGINS IN A DAW ON UBUNTU

reaper?
    i don't think wineasio is installed, no sound when i run
    i can't get wineasio to install, i get an error that wine/debug.h is missing
    let's try that again.

juce plugin host
    * apparently this now works! with pulse as audio interface. 
    * need to NOT have any inputs because it makes it glitchy af.
ardour
    don't know where to put the plugins
    is there sound? yes there is sound. so maybe ardour is the way to go about this?
    reading ardour manual
        what i produce are vsts, with .so extension which is linux for dll
        only vst 2.4 is supported
            ok, so maybe that is why everything crashed when I used the juce demo stuff
           from manual: Linux VST (LXVST) plugins are distributed as shared library files. They are typically installed in /usr/lib/lxvst, /usr/local/lib/lxvst or a directory mentioned in your LXVST_PATH environment variable.

    * audio works with jack audio device. 
    * plugins are indexed but i don't see them when adding plugins on a track.

MAKING REAPER WORK

* http://wiki.cockos.com/wiki/index.php/How_to_run_Reaper_in_Wine_on_Linux
* these instructions are to use thread priorities similar to windows: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/879835/wine-rt-101107.patch  
    * A recommended starting point might be runnning your app using: "env WINE_RT=15 WINE_SRV_RT=10 wine appname.exe"
* so my main problem is that i can't get wineasio to install. on the wineasio sourceforge page, they
* say to install the kxstudio repositories, then install wineasio from there. 
* found these instructions: https://lkubuntu.wordpress.com/2014/01/09/how-to-set-up-wineasio/
    sudo apt-get install software-properties-common wget
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kxstudio-debian/kxstudio
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install kxstudio-repos
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install wineasio
* ok, so now i got that wineasio installed. I went in reaper to select the asio drivers, but no inputs/outputs were available. Then it crashed, and it crashes everytime I try to open it, even after a reinstall. so moving on for now. I suppose that next I could either try to start over from the reaper official instructions, or use start over using kxstudio instructions.

DEBUGGING JUCE PLUGIN HOST

* ok, so the problem is with the gui. when i open the plugin that is when it crashes. it says: Opening VST UI: sBMP4 
    * this fucking line is in 
        audio plugin host/JuceLibraryCode/modules/juce_audio_processors/format_types/juce_VSTPluginFormat.cpp
____________________________________________________________________________________

TODO
    * LINUX	
        * actually, now juce plugin host is no longer working. crashes when opening sBMP4, which it does on startup
        * figure out how to use ctags
        * figure out how to run reaper
    * OTHER
        * use this library for filters: https://github.com/vinniefalco/DSPFilters
            * i got the RBJ filter working, but it causes some noise (see reaper project). Need to
            * perhaps use parameter smooting (this seems to not cause noise in the dsp filter juce
            * demo app)
